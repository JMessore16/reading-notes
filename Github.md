# Github Page

## GitHub is a version control system that allows you to update and revisit version of a file, you can add people to cooperate on the file with you and can add the files to your local machine using a clone.

### How to impose a change to Github

- First you have to add the file that you have imposed changes on
- Then you have to commit the file which will prompt you to add change notes so you can keep track of changes as well as cooperators
- Lastly you have to push the file with the changes to the repo, this is the final step and the changes will reflect in the repo.

### How to clone a repo to your local machine

In order to clone a repository you first have to navigate to a directory you want the clone to be housed in using your command line. Then find the repo you're trying to clone and find the link under the **Code** button and make sure you clone the HTTPS link. 

Once you have your link from the repo, you can then head back to your Terminal to input the command **git clone (link here)** , this will copy that repo to the current working directory and you can now enact changes to that repo as long as you have the proper access.
