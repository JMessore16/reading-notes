## What are Semantics in HTML?

### Semantics in html are the equivlant to markdown language, they differ in many ways though, Semantics will have a meaning which will be represented by a tag/element for example (<h1></h1>) this will represent the same as (#) in markdown.

#### Types of Semantics
- ** <p></p> **this command will allow for you to create a paragraph in your html file.
- (<em></em>) will emphasize the nested word or phrase makig it italic.
- (<strong></strong>) will allow your text to be more present by making it bold.

## Layout of Semantics

### Semantics will be used in a very specific way for example if i wanted to make a header on my webpage I would type (<h1>This is my header</h1>) this would display # This is my header in bold and large letters making it the most important or subject of the page.
