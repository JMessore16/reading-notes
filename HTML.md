### Semantics in html are the equivlant to markdown language, they differ in many ways though, Semantics will have a meaning which will be represented by a tag/element for example `<h1></h1>`this will represent the same as (#) in markdown.

#### Types of Semantics
- `<p></p>`this command will allow for you to create a paragraph in your html file.
- `<em></em>`will emphasize the nested word or phrase makig it italic.
- `<strong></strong>` will allow your text to be more present by making it bold.

### Semantics will be used in a very specific way for example if i wanted to make a header on my webpage I would type `<h1>This is my header</h1>` this would display # This is my header in bold and large letters making it the most important or subject of the page.
