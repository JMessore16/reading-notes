# Programming with JavaScript

## Functions
**Functions** are one of the fundamental building blocks of programming in JS.
A function should take an input and return an output where there is a defined relationship between the input and output.
### A function should be enclosed in `{...}` for example
function myFunc(theObject) {

  theObject.make = 'Toyota';
  
}
