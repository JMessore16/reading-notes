# Operators and Loops

## What is a loop?

**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

### Types of loops

-A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. 

`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement`

-The `do...while` statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
`do`

  `statement`
  
`while (condition);`

-A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`.
`let n = 0;`

`let x = 0;`

`while (n < 3) {`

  `n++;`
  
  `x += n;`
  
`}`

## What is an operator?

JavaScript has both binary and unary **operators**, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator

`operand1 operator operand2`

Example: `3+4 or x*y`
