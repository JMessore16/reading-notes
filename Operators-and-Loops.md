# Operators and Loops

## What is a loop?

**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

### Types of loops

-A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to `false`. 
`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement`
