## CSS Format/Modules/Syntax

**p** (this specifies the element or attribute that is being changed) **{**
    **color: Green;**(This would change the text in the element to green)
    **background-color: Orange;** (This would change the background of the element to orange)
    **font-size: 50px;** (this will change the size of specified font to 50px)
**}**

These are a few of the many different syntaxs that can be applied to an element within CSS.

## Why use CSS?

Without **CSS** your site would be extremely bland and not be eye catching to the audience you're looking to grab. CSS allows for a bland site to turn into something visually appealing.
