# Markdown

**Markdown** is the markup language you can use to format any document, used on Github.

## Headings

### Headings are created using (#) ranging from one to six, these are defined by importance with one being the most important, in most cases used for the main topic or purpose of the page!

## Types of inputs

- Line breaks (End a line with two or more spaces then type return)
- Paragraphs (use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text)
- Bold Text (add two astericks before and after the word or sentence)
