# What is the Terminal & Command Line?

The **command line** is a text-based interface that allows you to enact changes to your computer's files and much more!

## Some basic commands:
- **cd**: Changes the directory to a specified directory. For example: `cd ~/CodeFellows/course/`
- **mkdir**: Creates a new directory. For example: `mkdir ./codeFellows/course/course-101/`
- **pwd**: Outputs your working directory (the directory you are currently in). For example: `pwd` output: `Users/Jake/Codefellows/course`
- **ls**: Lists the files of your current directory. For example: `ls will show files such as course 102 within your course folder.

**cd**: In order to navigate through your files using the command line, you will use `cd` this will allow you to change your current file/directory. This can be confusing at first but is the same as changing your file in your file explorer or on your desktop and dragging and dropping that file. It is a very basic command that is input into your command line to allow for easier navigation via the terminal.
- `cd ./CodeFellows/course`: Sets your working directory to `/course/`. 
- `cd ..` : Sets your current directory to the previous directory right before it. For example if you are in `/CodeFellows/course/`, entering `cd ..` will bring your current directory to`/CodeFellows/`.
