## 1. Don't be afraid to use knowledge or expertise of others!
### When the going gets hard, don't be afraid to use the successes and knowledge of people around you, you do not know everything and can't be expected to! Many minds together can make hard work easier and more bearable!

## 2. Focus and minimize distractions!
### It can be difficult to remain strong in mind and remain on a task when you have tweets and snapchats popping up on your phone, do not be afraid to seperate yourself from these distractions when your utmost attention is needed. Do not be afraid to put your phone on silent or place it where it can't be easily accessed.

## 3. DO NOT GIVE UP!
### Something may seem so out of reach but becoming aware of when you're exhausted mentally can make or break that next chapter in whatever you may working on. Allow yourself to take breaks and reflect on the work you have completed and come back with a fresh mind, but DO NOT GIVE UP! We all fall victim of imposter syndrome at times and this can encroach on our ability to execute, do not fall into this easily avoidable trap set by yourself.
