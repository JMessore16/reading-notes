#JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows for functionality and implementation of website features.
## Javascript Variables
**Variables** are containers for storing data.

- `var` (example)
`var` x = 5;
`var` y = 6;
`var` z = x + y;
- `let` cannot be redefined. (example)
`let` x = "Jacob"
`let` x = 0;
// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared
- `const` must be assigned a value (example)
`const` PI = 3.14159

## Why use JavaScript?
**JavaScript** is used in order to execute certain actions that otherwise could not be done to a webpage, an example would be an active countdown on a site. Without the use of JS it would not be possible to have that interaction on the site.
